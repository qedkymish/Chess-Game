## Project Description

This is a simple text-based **Chess game** developed as part of the CSIS-297 Intermediate C++ Programming course at **Grossmont College**. The game implements object-oriented programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

The project simulates a Chess game, supporting all chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) with basic movement and legal move calculation. The game offers a **Free Play mode** for interactive piece movement and visual representation of the board.

## Features

- Full implementation of chess rules for all pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
- Accurate handling of legal moves, including diagonal captures and two-step pawn moves.
- Board visualization with an intuitive, text-based interface.
- Free Play mode allowing users to explore legal moves and move pieces.
- Modular design that separates game logic from the user interface.

## Game Modes

Currently, the game supports the following modes:

- **Free Play Mode**: A casual mode where you can move pieces freely. You can view the legal moves for any piece, make your own moves, and explore the board without any constraints or formal game rules. This mode is ideal for learning the game or just experimenting with piece movements.

**Upcoming Features**:
- **1v1 Multiplayer Mode**: Play against another player locally or over a network.
- **AI Mode**: Play against an AI opponent with varying difficulty levels.

# Chess Game

This is a simple text-based **Chess game** developed as part of the CSIS-297 Intermediate C++ Programming course at **Grossmont College**. The game implements object-oriented programming principles including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

The project simulates a Chess game, supporting all chess pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) with basic movement and legal move calculation. The game offers a **Free Play mode** for interactive piece movement and visual representation of the board.

## Features

- Full implementation of chess rules for all pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).
- Accurate handling of legal moves, including diagonal captures and two-step pawn moves.
- Board visualization with an intuitive, text-based interface.
- Free Play mode allowing users to explore legal moves and move pieces.
- Modular design that separates game logic from the user interface.

## Upcoming Features

- **1v1 Multiplayer Mode**: Play against another player locally or over a network.
- **AI Mode**: Play against an AI opponent with varying difficulty levels.
